Hack the North -- Pompeii
============
####Pompeii
Use Pompeii to parse important information from lecture recordings, such as homework, assessments, definitions, quotes, people, and key terms.

####Instant outlines at your fingertips.
Simply record a lecture. Pompeii will automatically parse the recording and create the lecture outline, available instantly when you log in online.

####Focus on important content.
Pompeii will only add important information to the outline. In a video course from Yale, about 80% of the information was marked as not important.
