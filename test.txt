All right. So today we are going to start by reviewing income and substitution effects. 
Because that's a pretty hard concept and pretty central to a lot of what we'll do for the rest of the 
semester. And then we're going to dive in and talk about an application, a more interesting application, 
of income and substitution effects which is the effects of wages on labor supply. 

So let's review. If you take the handout, grab the handout and look at the first figure, it's the same as the 
last figure of the previous lecture. To review, remember, whenever the price changes, a price change 
can be decomposed into two effects, the substitution effect and the income effect. The substitution 
effect is the change in the quantity demanded when the price changes, holding utility constant. 

And as we proved last time, that is always negative, 0 or negative. It is always non-positive. It's always 
true that when a price goes up, the substitution effect is negative. We proved that both mathematically 
and graphically last time showing that if you're going to hold utility constant, and the price of a good is 
going to go up, you're going to shift away from that good. OK. That's the substitution effect. 

In our example, we showed graphically how you measure a substitution effect. You draw a new 
imaginary budget constraint, BC3, which is parallel to the new budget constraint, BC2. So it's got the 
new price ratio but tangent to the old indifference curve. 

So the key thing to understand is the imaginary budget constraint, BC3, where it comes from. It's parallel 
to the new budget constraint. That is it's got the new marginal rate of transformation, the new slope, 
but it's tangent to the old indifference curve. That gets you to point B. And so the movement from A to B 
is the substitution effect.

So the total price effect is the one we demonstrated at the beginning of the last lecture. We raised the 
price of movies from $8 to $12. And we saw the number of movies consumed fell from 6 to 4. But what 
we can see now to understand what's underneath that is two things, an effect of the fact that prices 
change holding utility constant, and the fact that you're effectively poorer.
